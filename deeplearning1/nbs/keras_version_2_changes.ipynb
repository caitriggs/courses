    "#import cPickle as pickle\n",
    "import six.moves.cPickle as pickle\n",

    "#from keras.regularizers import l2, activity_l2, l1, activity_l1\n",

    "#from keras.utils.layer_utils import layer_from_config\n",
    "from keras.layers import deserialize as layer_from_config\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally I had to change set the image dim ordering via code, changing image_dim_ordering in keras.json didn't seem to work (changing backend worked though). Make sure to do it as early as possible, personally I'm doing right after the %matplotlib line\n",
    "```\n",
    "from keras import backend\n",
    "backend.set_image_dim_ordering('th')\n",
    "```\n",
    "Also, `nb_class` seems to have been renamed to `num_class` and `nb_sample` to `samples`, so when running Vgg16.fit, they need to aliased (or probably better to just modify vg16.py directly):\n",
    "```\n",
    "batches = vgg.get_batches(path+'train', batch_size=batch_size)\n",
    "val_batches = vgg.get_batches(path+'valid', batch_size=batch_size*2)\n",
